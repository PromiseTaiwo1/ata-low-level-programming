Understand argc and argv: Grasp the purpose and functionality of argc (argument count) and argv (argument vector) as parameters to the main function in C/C++.
Parse Command-Line Arguments: Learn techniques for iterating through and interpreting the values provided via command-line arguments.
Implement Basic Argument Validation: Develop logic to check for the correct number and types of arguments, providing user-friendly error messages when input is invalid.
Develop Functional CLI Tools: Practice structuring C/C++ programs to receive and act upon command-line input, building two distinct simple utilities.
Apply Conditional Logic: Utilize if/else statements and loops effectively to control program flow based on user arguments.Understand argc and argv: Grasp the purpose and functionality of argc (argument count) and argv (argument vector) as parameters to the main function in C/C++.
